### ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’œWelcome!ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’œ
My name is Yulissa Gil and I love I do! I have been developing for a total of 12 years starting from my humble 2011 Toshiba laptop my parents gifted me all those years ago.

A couple degree's later, I have the skills I need to create beautiful, elegant and memorable websites. I have had many opportunities and projects in a variety of languages and tools, here is a list of a couple of the things I know:
- JAVASCRIPT & NODEJS
- FRONT-END LANGUAGES
- COMMON JS FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS REACT, ANGULAR AND SVELTE/KIT
- CSS PREPROCESSORS
- DATA STRUCTURES & DATABASES SUCH AS MYSQL, FIREBASE & MONGODB
- AWS
- API INTEGRATION

I always strive to put my best work in every project I do. For more details on my experience, check out my [portfolio](https://yuwebdesign.carrd.co/)!
